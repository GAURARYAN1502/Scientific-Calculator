The Scientific Calculator Project is a responsive web-based application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, along with advanced functions like trigonometry (sin, cos, tan), logarithms, exponents, factorials, and square roots. The interface is user-friendly, mobile-optimized, and allows toggling between different modes for ease of use. This project demonstrates practical knowledge of mathematical functions, DOM manipulation, and responsive web design.
